# Homebrew formula for Lisa.
#
# This file is the master template. The actual formula that users install
# lives in a separate tap repository: github.com/oratis/homebrew-tap
# at Formula/lisa.rb. Per release, copy this file there and update:
#   - `url`     (npm tarball URL pinned to the new version)
#   - `sha256`  (sha256 of that tarball — compute with curl|shasum -a 256)
#
# See docs/PUBLISH.md for the full release ritual.

  # Use the npm tarball, NOT the GitHub source tarball — it ships pre-built
  # dist/ (compiled JS + 114 pixel-art mood portraits) so the formula doesn't
  # need to run `tsc` (which would require TypeScript devDependencies that
  # `npm install --global` skips).

  def caveats
    <<~CAVEATS
      Lisa runs on your own machine — sovereign by design. Set up an LLM key:

        mkdir -p ~/.lisa
        echo 'ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...' > ~/.lisa/config.env

      Or use any other supported provider (DeepSeek, Gemini, Ollama, …):
        https://github.com/oratis/LISA/blob/main/docs/PROVIDERS.md

      First launch:
        lisa             # interactive REPL
        lisa serve --web # browser UI on http://localhost:5757

      First-run birth ritual takes ~30 seconds (one-time).

      Diagnostics if something doesn't work:
        lisa doctor
    CAVEATS
  end

  test do
    # Smoke: --help shouldn't crash.
    assert_match "Lisa", shell_output("#{bin}/lisa --help")
  end
end
